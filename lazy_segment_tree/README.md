# Lazy Segment Tree

A segment tree implementation that supports range updates with lazy propagation.

The tree is built from an initial array and accepts user-defined merge, apply,
and compose functions. This makes it flexible enough to model scenarios such as
range addition with range sum queries or range assignment with range minimum
queries.
